## Features

- **Auto Start**: The timer automatically starts when it's the turn of a token owned by a player
- **Critical**: Chose the duration of the timer and when it goes critical, at this point the progress bar will turn red and start blinking
- **Sounds**: Play a looping sound when the timer goes critical (defaults to ticking) and a sound when the time is over
- **Go Next**: Automatically advance the turn tracker when a timer ends
- **Count Up**: Timer counts up like a stopwatch to show turn duration
- **Overtime**: Open-ended timer without hard stop to softly shame slow players (visible in digit mode only)
